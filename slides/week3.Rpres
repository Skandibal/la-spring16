Reflection & Discussion
========================================================

> I was pretty shocked that there would be objections to preparing students for the "real-world". Isn't that exactly the point of education - to prepare students to be successful in today's society? 
> -- Sarah

> While most of these skills are applicable to all domains, the purpose of education goes beyond preparing students for a future job - to instill a sense of inquiry, a love for deeper learning, an ability to think critically, etc. -- Anu

> NCLB certainly drove the skills-based craze with it's draconian emphasis on standardized testing in reading and math. -- Kristina

> My former principle said that part of the problem is that parents have been conditioned over the last ten years to see those standardized testing numbers as an accurate guage of the quality of thier children's schooling and they are pushing the district to continue with the emphasis on testing. -- Jenifer
